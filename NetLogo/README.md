This folder contains a [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/index.shtml) model representing how much students learn according to how good the teacher is at classroom control and teaching.

For more information, install NetLogo and open the file [Classroom_mimic.nlogo](Classroom_mimic.nlogo). The 'info' tab gives details on how to run the model.
